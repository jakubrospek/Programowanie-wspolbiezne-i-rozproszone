Here we discuss an example for a reader-writer problem.

In the examples different banks are doing 30 money transfers. Please download the files and run the examples: Bank, Bank2 and Bank3.

To which of the banks would you give your money?


Some additional notes:

In the file MoneyTransfer3.java you find the routine two versions of the method run(). Both are exactly the same - just the keyword synchronized is used in different ways:

synchronized public void run () { /* do something */ }

is a simplified way for writing:

public void run () { synchronized(this) { /* do something */ } }

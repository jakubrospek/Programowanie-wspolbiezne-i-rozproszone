In this example we want to see, how a deadlock can occur.

Please find below some files for doing money transfer between to bank accounts. Run the example several times. You should always find at end on both account 0 zl.

Please modify the code and synchronize the money transfer.

You can synchronize two objects a and b with

synchronized(A) {

     synchronized(B) {

           /* do something */

     }

}

Hint: In the case of a deadlock, you have to end the console (in other words: kill the Java Virtual Machine (JVM))
In eclipse you kill the JVM by a click on the red monitor in the Console tab.
